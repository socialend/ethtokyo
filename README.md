# What is Kizuna Protocol
Lending Platform Based on Proof of Humanity
Kizuna Protocol is a decentralized lending platform that leverages the power of WorldID for Proof of Humanity, enabling borrowers to access higher loan amounts than their collateral value. By incorporating a social scoring system and a decentralized P2P order book, the Kizuna Protocol provides a solution to traditional issues such as over-collateralization, poor collateral reliability, and volatility risks.

# Key Features
### Proof of Humanity
Kizuna Protocol utilizes WorldID to verify the borrower's identity, preventing Sybil attacks and allowing users to borrow at a higher interest rate.
### Social Scoring
By introducing WorldID on-chain data, the platform assigns activity ratings to users, which are influenced by transaction history, blacklist status, and social scores on Lens.
### Higher Loan Amounts
With Proof of Humanity as collateral, borrowers can unlock higher loan amounts.
### Decentralized P2P Order Book
This feature reduces volatility risks and allows easy adjustment of interest rates and risk.

# Future Plans
In addition to proving one's humanity, Kizuna Protocol aims to incorporate credit scores based on transactions such as Uniswap and NFT trades, as well as social activity scores on Lens. These additional factors will further serve as collateral, making the lending process more inclusive and efficient.
